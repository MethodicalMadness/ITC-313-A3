ITC-313 Assessment 3
Project was made in intellij with jdk 10.
Supplied is the src folder which holds the packages, as per intellijâ€™s
default setup.
Each task is a package. They are folders inside the src folder named task1
and task2.
Assuming you have an existing project and workspace set up and open, using
windows explorer place these package folders (task1 and task2) into your
project folder as per your IDEs folder structure requirements for
packages, and refresh the projects hierarchy in the IDE. This is slightly
different for all IDEs, but most will auto detect the files after a small
delay or after reopening project. In eclipse you need to go to File >
Refresh. Packages should then appear in your projects hierarchy explorer.
In each package is a Main.java. Running this will run just that packages
functionality.
